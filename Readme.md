- This is working with MAMP (on mac) so make sure that's installed.
- Create a database in the mysql interface provided by MAMP (in this case it was here: localhost:8888/phpmyadmin), create a table 'users' with the required columns.
- Put these files in the 'htdocs' folder or whichever folder is the root folder assigned by MAMP, Start the server go to localhost:8888/&lt;foldername&gt; It should work.
